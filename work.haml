              ased in New York, Easy Pairings takes the pain out of hiring for restaurants. Using Easy Pairings, restaurants are able to bypass the tedious tasks of posting job opening to sites like Craigslist, filtering dozens of applicants and scheduling interviews.  Easy Pairings lets restaurant managers skip straight to the interviews and gets worthy candidates easier access to jobs they really want.  Working with a small team, I did web design and front end development while working with a Python back-end programmer.

              fter five years of IT consulting, Waggit was my brainchild that got me hooked on entreprenuership and plugged into the New York startup community.  A website for dog owners to connect and help each other with dog sitting and dog walking, it was my first attempt at creating something from the ground up. I formed my own company and spent two years developing the product, overseeing design and development, doing marketing and building strategic partnerships.  It was the most challenging project of my career. Dogs and people helping each other make me happy, so I thought - &#8220;Why not combine the two?&#8221;

              orge Torres, the founder of TVLG, approached me to build a custom website for his law firm.  The site needed to explain their services and showcase his deep knowledge of patent law.  After capturing high-level requirements and getting a sense of the brand, I designed and developed a custom Wordpress site.  This required going through hundreds of stock photos for images that matched the content, selecting typography and creating custom templates.  The final result was a professional looking website with a modern edge.

              art of my journey as a web designer was doing a 3-month program called The Starter League in Chicago, IL.  During the program, I learned advanced HTML and CSS techniques and used preprocessors like HAML and SASS in a Ruby on Rails environment.  As a final project, I joined a team of developers to create Gearlance, a marketplace where people rent camera equipment directly from their peers, save money and be part of a community. The goal was to build a platform that could be white-labeled to support a P2P marketplace within any industry vertical.  Built on Twitter Bootstrap, I crafted the user experience, design aesthetic and did front end development.

              he idea of home exchange has been around a long time, but current popular sites have antiquated user experiences and designs.  So when the founder of HomeSwap approached me to be part of his team to make a site that made HomeSwapping easier, I thought it would be a great chance for me to practice my writing and develop inbound marketing strategies using social media.  I wrote for the blog, created e-mail marketing campaigns and was responsible for the Facebook and Twitter accounts.  I also interacted with members of the HomeSwap community to do customer development.

This required learning federal and state regulations and a thorough understanding of Assurant Health's user interface. I delivered process flow diagrams, use cases, wireframes, low fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes. I was also a project manager for a large-scale implementation of 3rd party software that replaced the entire legacy agent licensing technology at Assurant.  I presented solutions and reported status to executive leadership while managing cross-functional teams.
