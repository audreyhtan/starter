            <h4 class="headline">My Story</h4>
            <p>Born in a sleepy suburb of Chicago, I was raised by my parents in Glen Ellyn, IL.  Both my Mom and Dad were born in Korea but share a unique Korean-Chinese heritage.  My Mom is half Chinese, half Korean.  My Dad is three-quarters Korean, one-quarter Chinese.  My Mom, a tom-boyish go getter from the Seoul, and my Dad, the studious eldest child of a famous Chinese herbal doctor in Taegu.  They came to the States in 1970 where they had me and my two older brothers, Albert and Philip.  I have very fond memories of family vacations, getting beat up by my brothers, and riding my bike to the community swimming pool. I was truly blessed.  I had a very happy childhood.</p>
            <p>I went to the University of IL in Urbana Champaign where I got my degree in Business.  Never much interested in the party scene, I kept to my books, grew a small group of friends and proved myself a responsible young lady.  No dramatic stories, no overnight transformations. Just slow, steady personal growth.</p>
            <p>Before getting a job in consulting, I was a counselor at the Mountain Meadow summer camp in Susanville, CA.  For 3 months, I wrangled horses while looking after kids ranging from 8-14 years.  After wrangling horses, I worked as a store manager at a Banana Republic by my parents house in Wheaton. Very different jobs, but I both have changed the way I view the value of hard work and customer service.  To this day, I still can't believe I worked those jobs.</p>
            <p>I landed a job at Capgemini's Consulting Services in early 2006 and stayed there for over 5 years.  Having a natural interest in computers and technology, it was a natural place for me to thrive in my skills as a professional.  Every day, I was solving problems, presenting recommendations, and handling clients. Consulting gave me the professional refinement that only comes with time and experience.</p>
            <p>After establishing myself as a professional, I decided it was time to take a risk in my career.  Entrepreneurship runs in my family, so it's no wonder that in April 2011, I decided to venture out and start my own business.  The business was an online community where pet owners could connect and barter services with people in their neighborhood.  The idea was novel and pet industry was booming. Doing that business put me into a mode of accelerated learning.  I learned the importance of networking, the art of attracting investors and the challenges of early stage startups.  I put myself out there and it was the most radical things I've ever done.  It was the scariest time in my life, but it's when I learned most about technology, others and myself.</p>
            <p>At the core, I'm made of the same stuff as every other person.  I put my pants on the same way as everyone else, but just like everyone else, my story is unique.  My story has twists and turns.  It is a mystery novel and a text-book at the same time. Thankfully, my story isn't done.</p>
