      Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>

      <p>I met Ken Hill at a Brooklyn Beta event last year and it was his enthusiasm for working at TED that has brought me to this application.  Given my previous experience as the founder of my own startup and my love for innovation, I was delighted to find the open position for Product Development Associate at TED.</p>

      <p>In my previous roles as a consultant and for my own business, I did product design, usability testing, and requirements gathering.  I wore lots of hats, but my specialty and focus was always designing interfaces that would help end users accomplish their tasks and feel delighted using the site.  Creating wireframes, explaining use cases, and mapping out user flows are things I sincerely enjoy.  Through my experience, I gained deep insight into how a user thinks, feels and interacts with web applications.</p>

      <p>What's more, I'm also technical.  HTML & CSS and jQuery are tools in my arsenal that allow me to imagine and actually create better designs.   Exposure to front-end web development makes me better at understanding the technology behind the interactions that we design.  Combine my technical knowledge with my passion for creating amazing interfaces, and I know could make a positive impact at TED.</p>

      <p>I'm self sufficient, extremely organized and understand how my role fits into the big picture.  Working with other designers, developers and product managers is second nature to me.  I thrive in collaborative environments where people listen and learn from each other, and I know this is the kind of workplace that TED supports.</p>

      <p>If you have additional questions, I would be happy to meet for an in person interview at your earliest convenience.    I'm also available via phone at 630.485.0665 or email at audreyhtan@gmail.com.  Thank you for considering me to be part of the TED family and I look forward to discussing my candidacy for the position with you further.</p><br><br>

      <p>Ever most sincerely,</p>
