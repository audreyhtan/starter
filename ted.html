      Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>

      <p>I met Ken Hill at a Brooklyn Beta event last year and it was his enthusiasm for working at TED that has brought me to this application.  Given my previous experience as the founder of my own startup and my love for innovation, I was delighted to find the open position for Product Development Associate at TED.</p>

      <p>In my previous roles as a consultant and for my own business, I did product design, usability testing, and requirements gathering.  I wore lots of hats, but my specialty and focus was always designing interfaces that would help end users accomplish their tasks and feel delighted using the site.  Creating wireframes, explaining use cases, and mapping out user flows are things I sincerely enjoy.  Through my experience, I gained deep insight into how a user thinks, feels and interacts with web applications.</p>

      <p>What's more, I'm also technical.  HTML & CSS and jQuery are tools in my arsenal that allow me to imagine and actually create better designs.   Exposure to front-end web development makes me better at understanding the technology behind the interactions that we design.  Combine my technical knowledge with my passion for creating amazing interfaces, and I know could make a positive impact at TED.</p>

      <p>I'm self sufficient, extremely organized and understand how my role fits into the big picture.  Working with other designers, developers and product managers is second nature to me.  I thrive in collaborative environments where people listen and learn from each other, and I know this is the kind of workplace that TED supports.</p>

      <p>If you have additional questions, I would be happy to meet for an in person interview at your earliest convenience.    I'm also available via phone at 630.485.0665 or email at audreyhtan@gmail.com.  Thank you for considering me to be part of the TED family and I look forward to discussing my candidacy for the position with you further.</p><br><br>

      <p>Ever most sincerely,</p>

      <h3>Writing Sample</h3>
        <p>Advancing women in technology is something I'm very passionate about.  Here's a writing sample that explains my take on why it's an important issue.</p><br><br>


        <h4>The Importance of Women in Tech</h4>
        <p><em>by Audrey Tan</em></p>
        <p>Published by Skillcrush and Women2.0</p><br>

      <p><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marissa-mayer" rel="crunchbase" title="Marissa Mayer" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer</a>&nbsp;and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/sheryl-sandberg" rel="crunchbase" title="Sheryl Sandberg" target="_blank">Sheryl Sandberg</a>&nbsp;have recently made headlines for their high profile jobs at top tech companies in America. &nbsp;But I hope you agree these women aren't in these positions just because they're women. &nbsp;They have proven track records and have reputations for delivering results. &nbsp;Their influence fuels communities&nbsp;that do not simply include women in technology - but herald it. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>It's critical for women to be in technology for the following reasons. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Of women, for women, by women.</strong> &nbsp;Just like Abraham Lincoln famously spoke of government as - "of the people, by the people, for the people" -technology needs to be the same for women. &nbsp;If empathy is one of the key drivers of building products with high market-fit, then how on Earth is a man able to truly understand how it hard it is to know what makeup to buy? &nbsp;How is he suppose to use technology to help her with a recommendation? &nbsp;Especially where women are the target consumer, product design, messaging, and pricing require a subtle&nbsp;female&nbsp;finesse that only a woman could devise.</p>
      <p>So unless what happend to Mel Gibson in the movie <em><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207201/" rel="imdb" title="What Women Want" target="_blank">What Women Want</a></em> actually comes true, sorry boys - you're still in the dark.</p>
      <p><strong>Formation vs breakage.</strong> &nbsp;Natural diamonds can take billion years to form. &nbsp;But once they are formed, they are one of the hardest substances on Earth. &nbsp;And just like a diamond takes time to form, so does industry.&nbsp; The rise of the Internet and its impact on the global economy has already proven itself. &nbsp;It has defined our generation. &nbsp;But we are just at the starting gate. &nbsp;<em>If we as women, fail to be involved in the formation of an industry, we are precluding ourselves from being the future leaders of those industries.</em> &nbsp;It is better, easier and far more likely to grow with an industry than it is to expect to break into it. &nbsp;Imagine pounding a diamond with a hammer vs already being deeply embedded into its natural elements. &nbsp;So as the world of technology grows, it's important that we as women, insert ourselves now and form with it. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Optimization over equality.</strong> &nbsp;A friend said to me the other day, "Wow - you must be around a lot of tech guys." &nbsp;And yes, it's true. &nbsp;As a female founder in tech, I am consistently outnumbered by guys in t-shirts and hoodies. &nbsp;But it never really bothers me because I don't see it as a numbers game, it's a optimizing game. &nbsp;To make the best products, to build the best companies, having a team of 5 men and 5 women does not automatically improve the rate of success. &nbsp;<em>It's about looking at it from the&nbsp;perpective of optimization - fitting the right person for the right role.</em> &nbsp; I also happen to believe that women are better fit for certain roles AND have the power to diversity thought process for new ideas and better output. &nbsp;Therefore having at least some women representation is always&nbsp;beneficial. &nbsp;So sure - &nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" title="Dollar Shave Club" target="_blank">Dollar Shave Club</a> may not need a full stack team of women product experts, but surely - &nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Bodyform/posts/10151186887359324" title="Bodyform Ad" target="_blank">Bodyform</a> might? &nbsp;This video is worth watching. &nbsp;Really.</p><br>
      <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bpy75q2DDow" width="700"></iframe></p>
      <p>"You did that, Richard. &nbsp;You. &nbsp;Well done." &nbsp;Well done indeed.</p><br>
      <p><strong>It's not "just because".</strong> &nbsp;This trend of women in startups is not a "just because" thing. &nbsp;We are not proponents of women in tech <em>just&nbsp;because</em>&nbsp;of all the press and j<em>ust&nbsp;because&nbsp;</em>the world should be fair. &nbsp;"Just because" is possibly the worst reasoning I know. &nbsp;It's important because we should want make the best businesses - heck - the best version of ourselves that we can possibly be. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I attended the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.women2.com/" title="Women2" target="_blank">Women2.0</a> conference in New York, and I met so many fearless women who are making worthwhile products and embedding themselves into a growing industry. &nbsp;I took home a few nuggets of knowledge and left inspired to keep pace with my fellow women attendees. &nbsp;Really glad I went.</p>
      <p>At the very core of any movement, there are those that uphold the ideals for positive and meaningful change. &nbsp;By being examples of tech savvy women who are generous with their talents and relentlessly hard working, we're setting the stage for women who will come after us, building a legacy of real impact.</p>
