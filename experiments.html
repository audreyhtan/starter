<h3 class = "homework-title">Detailed Positioning</h3>
<p>Star Date: April 17, 2013 (SL02)</p>
<div class="post-text">
<p>This weeks assignment was to investigate the galaxy of detailed positioning.  Understanding the behavior of floats, different species of positioning and the third dimension z-index was top priority.
</p>

<p>I practiced floats by creating a Twitter-Bootstrapped inspired grid that is also 960px wide, but only has 6 columns.  I used this as my chance to add a <a href="photos.html">photo gallery</a> and positioned my images using the new column widths and floating all the images in rows that had different heights.  I really should have optimized my images beforhand because the pages originally loaded super slow. Even after running them through <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>, the files were still pretty huge and scrolling down the page created a lag.  The only way I knew how to fix this was to open each photo in Photoshop and save each one for a Web device. Huge time suck.  Is this the only way to do this?  </p>
<p>To practice positioning, I thought - "Hey! I should make my <a href="family.html">family tree</a>!"  I had no idea it would turn out to be a LOT of work.  I had to collect even MORE photos (this required a lot of Facebook stalking), crop and resize them and create a custom image that would be the 'tree' in the background.  Friggen tree.
</p>
<p>To sum it up, here's what I learned/remember about positioning:</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>If you're going to float stuff in a div, put it in a group with these properties.  Just do it.  Works across browsers that your pesky boss will ask you about. </li>
    <code>.group:before, .group:after {content: "";display: table;}
.group:after {clear: both;}
.group{*zoom: 1;}</code></br></br>
<li>Positioning with CSS generally stinks.  It's confusing, the terms are not intuitive and it's frustraing.  So many times I asked myself, "WHY CAN'T YOU JUST MOVE OVER THERE!?"  My big takeaway was try to keep things simple and think of ways you can keep things in the natural flow.  That's my opinion at least.  But if you must do anything beyond the static default position, here's how I remember the difference between the other ones. </br></br>
  <strong>Relative</strong> is about where it would have been if it had been static.  It's like that surfer from the beach that wants to hold his place in line but has just got to position himself on that wave over there.  He's all like, "Hey man, mind holding my static spot here while I chill over there?  It's all relative man!  Duuuude.  Thanks, man."</br></br>
  <strong>Absolute</strong> is about the parent element.  It's like your parents telling you you must be here at all times according to their boundries, as long as they've stated their position other than the normal/default static position.  It's like your parent saying, "you must absolutely do what I say." Absolute positioning is always relative to the parent, but if your parents are flakey and haven't stated their position, deciding vote goes to the body.</br></br>
  <strong>Fixed</strong> is like putting a sticky note on your computer.  It's going to stay there, no matter where you scroll on the page.
</li></br></br>
<li>Z-index is great for letting your absolute or relatively positioned objects rest on top of eachother and display in the order you want.  It's like when you're holding a fanned out deck of cards, the card that's on top is closest to you - that's the card with the highest z-index.  Remember the x and y axis we learned about in grade school math?  The y-axis arrow went up and the x-axis went to the right. Imagine the z-axis as an arrow that pops out of the screen, straight towards you.  The z-index makes things 3D.
</li>
