<h3 class = "homework-title">jQuery</h3>
<p>Star Date: May 16, 2013 (SL06)</p>
<div class="post-text">
<p>jQuery was the lesson I was most looking foward to. <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> is an "open source JavaScript library written by John Resig that simplifies the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."  Thank you, Mr. Resig!  Commonly used interactions that web-users have grown accustom are all nicely packaged in easy to use jQuery.  JavaScript is great in all, but if the work's already been done and simplied to easy to use code, I'm all for it.</p>

<p>Here's my attempt to pay homage to Wayne's World with a 'Camera One. Camera Two.' effect. "Tsaaaaaang!"</p>

  <div class="toggle">
    <div class="camera-1">
      <img class="baby" src="assets/img/camera1.jpg" alt="waynes world">
    </div>
    <div class="camera-2" >
      <img class="baby" style="display: none;" src="assets/img/camera2.jpg" alt="waynes world">
    </div>
    <span class="btn btn-info camera">Camera 1</span>
  </div>
</br>
<p>Here's the code for changing the text and color of the button.  This I had to Goggle for.</p>
<code>
  $('.btn').click(function(){</br>
    $('img').toggle();</br>
    $(this).text(function(i, text){</br>
      return text === "Camera 1" ? "Camera 2" : "Camera 1";</br>
    })</br>
    $(this).toggleClass('warn');</br>
  });
</code>
</br>
<p>After getting my getting my <a href="#alert">alerts</a> to fade out slowly after clicking, I looked into updating my <a href="photos.html" alt="audrey tan photo">photo page</a> with some slideshow functionality.  Turns out, there are so many customizable slideshow jQuery plugins that can be customized, it makes sense to use what's out there.  I personally liked <a href="http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/" alt="FancyBox" title="FancyBox App" target="_blank">FancyBox</a>. The documentation was good, it was easy to customize, and seems pretty widely used.   </p>

<p>I'm really excited jQuery exists. While I"m still learning Javascript, I can still design a lot of useful user interactions with the libaries out there.  Poking around the jQuery website, I found <a href="http://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">jQueryUi</a>, which is a "curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library."  So basically, it has common user interface components that can be styled to match your site, then added in very easily. Handy stuff!</p>

<h3 class = "homework-title">Preprocessors</h3>
<p>Star Date: May 13, 2013 (SL05)</p>
<div class="post-text">
<p>This weeks lesson introcuced us to Preprocessors.  Simply put, a preprocessor is, 'a program that takes one type of data and converts it to another type of data.' Seems like there are a lot of preprocessors out there, but in the context of this lesson, we learned about two: 1) <a href='http://haml.info/' alt='haml'><em>Haml</em></a> and 2) <a href='http://sass-lang.com/' alt='SASS'><em>Sass</em></a>.  We were also introduced to nifty resources like <a hrf='http://incident57.com/codekit/' alt='CodeKit' target='_blank'>Codekit</a>, <a href='http://compass-style.org/' alt='Compass' target='_blank'>Compass</a> and <a href='http://bourbon.io/' alt='Bourbon' target='_blank'>Bourbon</a>.
</p>
<p>Before this class, I had never heard of Haml.  Haml essentially replaced the need for opening and closing tags with the "%" sign and handles nesting with strict indentation.  There are a few nifty shortcuts in Haml, like not having to declare a < div > element, and even stuff like <code>!!! 5</code> instead of <code>< !DOCTYPE html ></code>.  But for me, the one thing that makes haml attractive is that after all the processing magic happens, your html will be perfectly indented.  I imagine those that are OCD about code cleanliness would enjoy using haml.  My second favorite thing about using haml is that I don't have to worry about closing all my tags.  Especially as a newbie, I was spending a lot of time debugging my code, realizing that it was just because I lost my closing < /div> tag.  I suspect that people don't go as crazy for haml as other preprocessors because html is usually more straightforward and the amount of time you save isn't as much compared to Sass. Still, I have a feeling I'll be using haml for future proejcts.</p>

<p>SASS? SCSS? LESS?? WTHIT??? (What the heck is this???) I had heard of all of these prior to the class, but I was bewildered about what they were, what they did, how they were different and why I should care.  Thankfully, the mystery is over.  These preprocessors turn data into CSS.  That's about it.  Personally, I wasn't really bothered by the brackets and semicolons in CSS.  I got used to them and they got used to me.  So why need a preprocessor for CSS? To me, the main reasons are to minimize repetition, aid maintainability and give us even more power over what content looks like. </p>

<p>For example, using '@extends' and '@mixins' allow us to declare styles once, and reuse them later.  This also helps maintainability. If I say on Monday, 'The box shadow for all my buttons should be green' but inevitably change my mind and prefer the blue color of my Honda Civic, I don't have to update all my button classes, I can just update the @mixin I used. None of this '-webkit-box-shadow' '-moz-box-shadow' blah blah blah nonesense. Less lines of CSS to write, less to update.  Yipee Kai Yay.</p>

<p>One of the most intriguing things about SASS is it's ability to handle variables, functions, for loops and other things that make it way more dynamic. Colors can be automatically calulated from hex to RGB, converted into its complimentary color, lightened, darkened, mixed, faded ... lions and tigers and bears oh my!  There's are so many possiblities with color.  Folks with a passion for color theory and like designing in the browser would really get a kick out of this kind of power.  I'm so glad I found <a href="http://sassme.arc90.com/" alt='SassMe website' title='SassMe' target='_blank'>SassMe</a> - a way to "visualize SASS color functions in real-time without compiling." It's pretty nifty for understanding how color alterations in SASS works, getting the values you want and pasting them right into your code. Fun! </p>

<p>Final note:  One of my favorite things about preprocessors that wasn't mentioned in the class is that if you make a syntax error, it won't just pout and not compile.  It tells you WHY it's not compiling and exactly where to fix your mistake.  This is HUGE.  Another reason why preprocessors are great.</p>

<p>Tags, semicolons and brackets were once the bain of my existance.  Only when I started practicing a lot in a text editor did I get used to the syntax and organization of HTML and CSS.  And now with preprocessors, it's like I don't need to worry so much about it.</p>

<h3 class = "homework-title">Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>Star Date: May 3, 2013 (SL04)</p>
<div class="post-text">
<p>RWD still seems like a buzzword in web development, but when you think about how many new ways we consume news and media compared to 10 years ago, it's a good idea to understand the tech that's responsible and keep up with the changes.</p>

<p>Here are some of the main takeaways from this weeks lesson:</p>

<ol>
<li>When designing a site to be responsive, it's smarter to <strong>design</strong> for content, not devices.  New screen sizes and improved retina displays are just a few examples of things that are constantly changing, so if you're designing strictly for those things, it will be like trying design fancy clothes for a growing 2 year old.</li>
<li>Running this JavaScript function in web browser developer tools will tell you the size of your window.</br>
<code>window.outerWidth</code></br>
But apparently there's a web-kit bug that confuses the scrollbar as part of the window sometimes, so it might be a few pixels off.  Still - it was cool to start running commands in the Google Chrome console.
My TA Dan Kim told us about a Chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/windowresizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh"
alt="Window Resizer" target="_blank">Window Resizer</a>. It not only allows you to snap to specific common sizes, but also tells you your window size in the lower right hand corner as you resize your window.  Thanks, Dan!
</li>
<li>I also learned the difference between responsive and fluid design.
  <ul>
    <li>Responsive design is implemented with media queries.The queires figure out what kind of viewport size, screen resolution, etc and then displays the content according to how we've responsively designed it. If people are talking about breakpoints and min/max-widths, they're talking about responsive design.</li>
    <li>Fluid design is all about percentages instead of pixels.  So instead of saying "This div is going to be 400px wide within its 1000px wide container" you say "This div is going to be 40% of the width of its container."  Fluid designs support the notion of designing for proportion vs fixed dimensions that could look wonky on different viewports.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>
<p>I just finished the work to convert most of my site to be fluid and responsive.  It was tricky, but I think I got it.  Not only did I learn something new, I'm cleaning up code from prior weeks that I've since learned how to do better.Can't wait to get more practice.</p>

<h3 class = "homework-title">Complex Selectors</h3>
<p>Star Date: April 24, 2013 (SL03)</p>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Complex selectors are complex, but just like people, complex can mean fun.  This weeks assignement was to use complex selectors to target specific elements that have certain characteristics.  Complex selectors improve the ability to separate content from style.  Great for styling navigation, tables or controls that are more dynamic.</p>

<p>This is the second pargraph of my entry, and looks like it's indenting just the say I want.  The indent is by percentage instead of pixels.  I'm getting excited about RWD for next weeks lesson.  Also had some fun and made the first paragraph italics.  Think it will be good to get into the habit of summarizing each post in an opening paragraph that's styled a bit different.   Here's the code I used.</p>
  <code>.post-text p:nth-of-type(n+2) {</br>
  text-indent: 10%;</br>
}</br>

.post-text p:first-of-type { </br>
  font-style: italic;</br>
}
</code>
<p>Also used Attribute Begins and Attribute Equals to target every link that is a secure website and every link that opens in a new window.  Had to add some padding and the url to the images. :before and :after are so fun to use!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chase.com/" target = "_blank" alt="Chase Bank">Chase Bank </a>is my bank.  I guess they're an okay bank.  They kinda feel like the bad guys.  This link opens in a new window and is also a secure link.</p>

<p>Here is a link that opens in a new window <a href="http://waggit.com" target="_blank">Waggit</a>.  Waggit is for people that love dogs.  People who love dogs are awesome.  Therefore Waggit is awesome!!!</p>
<code>
.post-text a[href^="https://"]:before { </br>
  padding: 2px;</br>
  content: url(../img/lock.png);</br>
}</br>
</br>
.post-text a[target="_blank"]:after { </br>
  padding: 2px; </br>
  content: url(../img/ui-tab--arrow.png); </br>
}</code>

<h3 class = "homework-title">Detailed Positioning</h3>
<p>Star Date: April 17, 2013 (SL02)</p>
<div class="post-text">
<p>This weeks assignment was to investigate the galaxy of detailed positioning.  Understanding the behavior of floats, different species of positioning and the third dimension z-index was top priority.</p>

<p>I practiced floats by creating a Twitter-Bootstrapped inspired grid that is also 960px wide, but only has 6 columns.  I used this as my chance to add a <a href="photos.html">photo gallery</a> and positioned my images using the new column widths and floating all the images in rows that had different heights.  I really should have optimized my images beforhand because the pages originally loaded super slow. Even after running them through <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>, the files were still pretty huge and scrolling down the page created a lag.  The only way I knew how to fix this was to open each photo in Photoshop and save each one for a Web device. Huge time suck.  Is this the only way to do this? </p>

The only way I knew how to fix this was to open each photo in Photoshop and save each one for a Web device. Huge time suck.  Is this the only way to do this?</p>

<p>To practice positioning, I thought - "Hey! I should make my <a href="family.html">family tree</a>!"  I had no idea it would turn out to be a LOT of work.  I had to collect even MORE photos (this required a lot of Facebook stalking), crop and resize them and create a custom image that would be the 'tree' in the background.  Friggen tree.</p>

<p>To sum it up, here's what I learned/remember about positioning:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If you're going to float stuff in a div, put it in a group with these properties.  Just do it.  Works across browsers that your pesky boss will ask you about. </li>
    <code>
      .group:before,</br>
      .group:after { </br>
        content: ""; </br>
        display: table;</br>
    }</br>
      .group:after {</br>
        clear: both;</br>}</br>
      .group{</br>
        *zoom: 1;</br>
}</code></br></br>
<li>Positioning with CSS generally stinks.  It's confusing, the terms are not intuitive and it's frustraing.  So many times I asked myself, "WHY CAN'T YOU JUST MOVE OVER THERE!?"  My big takeaway was try to keep things simple and think of ways you can keep things in the natural flow.  That's my opinion at least.  But if you must do anything beyond the static default position, here's how I remember the difference between the other ones. </br></br>
  <em>Relative</em> is about where it would have been if it had been static.  It's like that surfer from the beach that wants to hold his place in line but has just got to position himself on that wave over there.  He's all like, "Hey man, mind holding my static spot here while I chill over there?  It's all relative man!  Duuuude.  Thanks, man."</br></br>
  <em>Absolute</em> is about the parent element.  It's like your parents telling you you must be here at all times according to their boundries, as long as they've stated their position other than the normal/default static position.  It's like your parent saying, "you must absolutely do what I say." Absolute positioning is always relative to the parent, but if your parents are flakey and haven't stated their position, deciding vote goes to the body.</br></br>
  <em>Fixed</em> is like putting a sticky note on your computer.  It's going to stay there, no matter where you scroll on the page.
</li></br></br>
<li>Z-index is great for letting your absolute or relatively positioned objects rest on top of eachother and display in the order you want.  It's like when you're holding a fanned out deck of cards, the card that's on top is closest to you - that's the card with the highest z-index.  Remember the x and y axis we learned about in grade school math?  The y-axis arrow went up and the x-axis went to the right. Imagine the z-axis as an arrow that pops out of the screen, straight towards you.  The z-index makes things 3D.
</li>
